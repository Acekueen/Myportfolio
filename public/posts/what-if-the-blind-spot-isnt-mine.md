title: What If the Blind Spot Isn't Mine?

In most organisations, feedback is often treated as a one-way street.
A manager shares their perspective, the employee listens, reflects, and adapts.
It sounds simple — even virtuous — but in reality, it is rarely that balanced.

There is an unspoken assumption that feedback always exposes a **blind spot on the receiver's side**, while the giver's perspective remains unquestioned. But what if, sometimes, the blind spot sits on the other side of the table?

## **The Unseen Weight of One-Way Reflection**

The way feedback is framed often places the emotional and intellectual labour on the recipient.
Employees are expected to "reflect," "own it," and "take it on board."
Yet how often do we ask whether the feedback giver has done their own reflection?

Context, visibility, and presence all matter. Feedback that lacks these can unintentionally misrepresent performance or motivation. When that happens, the employee ends up doing the heavy lifting — reconciling words that may not be grounded in the full picture.

## **When Feedback Becomes Opinion**

Feedback is valuable when it is grounded in shared understanding.
But when it's delivered without context — perhaps from a distance, or after a period of limited visibility — it can turn into **opinion dressed as truth**.
Even well-intentioned feedback can feel disconnected when it doesn't reflect the realities someone has been navigating.

That's why reflection needs to be mutual. Growth is not just about how well we accept feedback — it's also about how thoughtfully we give it.

## **Rethinking the Feedback Culture**

What if feedback conversations started from curiosity instead of conclusion?
What if leaders paused before writing or delivering feedback to ask themselves:

* *Do I have the full context?*
* *Have I been close enough to understand the circumstances?*
* *Am I open to learning something from this conversation too?*

That shift would turn feedback from a verdict into a dialogue. Accountability would remain, but it would be **shared**, not imposed.

## **The Shared Responsibility of Reflection**

The healthiest professional environments are those where both parties reflect — not because someone asked them to, but because both recognise that **perspective has limits**.

When feedback is treated as a shared act of learning rather than a top-down directive, people stop performing for approval and start growing with trust.

Because not every blind spot belongs to the person receiving feedback.
Sometimes, it belongs to the mirror itself.
